# Create an API of cars 

In this project we will create our own API of cars using the HTTP methods GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
we will use the response codes. 

## What you will be doing

This project will allow you to practise using:

> HTTP methods and response codes

This project assumes you've already had experience with:

> - Express basic setup
> - Javascript Arrays

## Tasks

For these tasks, you are expected to write your code in the file `server.js`


## Task 1 - Getting ready

1. Initialise npm into your project
   `npm init -y`
2. Set the `package.json` type to module
3. Install the express.js npm package
   `npm i express`
4. Create a file for your server (`server.js`)


## Task 2 - Set up your server

##### starter code
```javascript
import express from 'express';
const app = express();

app.use(express.urlencoded({extended:true}));
app.use(express.json());

app.listen(3000, () => {
   console.log("The server is listening") 
});
```

## Task 3 - Initialize an array of carobjects 

  1. Initialize an array of carobjects, you can choose how you form your objects. 
 ```javascript
  const cars = [ 
    { id:1, name:'Volvo' }, 
    { id:2, name:'BMW' },
    { id:3, name:'Audi' }];
   ```


## Task 4 - Add middleware for a GET request to '/api/cars'
Write some middleware that will respond to the path `/api/cars`. This middleware should return a json `response` with the list of cars and a status code 200. 


## Task 5 - Add middleware for a GET request to 'api/cars/:id'
Write some middleware that will respond to the path `/cars/:id`. This middleware should return a json `response` with a car by parameter id and a status code 200. 
- If a faulty id parameter was supplied it should return status code 400 (Bad Request). 
- If an id was supplied but it can't be found in the array return status code 404.

## Task 6 - Add middleware for a POST request to 'api/cars/add'
Write some middleware that will respond to a post request to the path `api/cars/add`. 
A car object should be added to the array of cars. This middleware should return a json `response` with the added car object and status code 200.  The body of the request can look like this and should contain the necessary fields to create the new car object: 
 ```json
{
    "id":"4",
    "name":"Renault"
}
 ```



## Task 7 - Add middleware for a PUT request to 'api/cars/update/:id'
Write some middleware that will respond to the path `api/cars/update/:id`. This middleware should update an existing car and return a json `response` with the list of cars (including the newly added one) and a status code 200. 

- If a faulty id parameter was supplied it should return status code 400 (Bad Request). 
- If an id was supplied but it can't be found in the array return status code 404.

## Task 8 - Add middleware for a DELETE request to 'api/cars/delete/:id'
Write some middleware that will respond to the path `api/cars/delete/:id`. This middleware should delete the car by id and should return a json `response` with the list of cars (excluding the car that was deleted) and a status code 200.

- If a faulty id paramater was supplied it should return status code 400 (Bad Request). 
- If an id was supplied but it can't be found in the array return status code 404.
